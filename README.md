The Project provided me a hands-on learning experience and encouraged me to apply Python concepts such as string, string manipulation, function and operations related to strings, Web Scraping using request and beautiful soup. Through this project, I gained practical problem-solving skills and enhanced, my proficiency in Python programming.

**Concepts I used in this projects are:**
- HTTP Requests
- Web Scraping using Beautiful Soup
- Data Extraction
- String Manipulation
- String Search and Matching
- Data Analysis and Classification

**Context**
The task is to creating a powerful movie analysis and review aggregator for a media company. The application should allow users to retrieve and display IMDb's Top 50 MoviesÂµ. Implementing web scraping using Python's requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to gather information about the top 50 rated movies on IMDb and then perform additional operations on this data. Sort the movie data by IMDb ratings in descending order. Create a list containing the top 5 movies with the highest IMDb ratings. Iterate through the top 5 movies and print their details, including movie name, IMDb rating, release year, votes, and genre. 
By following this, I will build a movie analysis and review aggregator that retrieves IMDb's top-rated movies and presents the top 5 movies with their key information. This application will help users discover highly-rated films quickly and efficiently.
